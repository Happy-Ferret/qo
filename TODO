- specify target type (exe, so/dll)
- figure out what to do about assembly language
- figure out how to change debug symbol format on Mac OS X and MSVC to one embedded in the binary (rather than .dSYM and .pdb files, respectively)
- toolchain-specific pkg-configs and pkg-config options for msvc
- somehow figure out how to add -I (and others?) to rc
- sdl-config? wx-config?
- in-source build tag exclusion
- a 'unix' OS tag (requires in-source build tag exclusions)

* TODO also need to add:
	* gresource files: `.xml` with root tag `<gresources>`
	* Qt moc files (will need some way to distinguish; same as C headers)
	* Qt Designer files: `.ui` as XML with root tag `<ui>`
	* anything else (send ideas!)
* TODO can these be embedded?
	* gettext files: `.po`
	* Qt Linguist files: `.ts` as XML with root t ag `<TS>`
	* anything else (send ideas!)
