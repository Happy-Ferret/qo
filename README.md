qo is a simple program that builds C and C++ programs (though I can add more supported languages later).

Usage is simple:

```
$ cd project
$ ls
file.c file2.c file3.c file4.c project.h
$ qo
...
$ ./project
```

There's no makefile or configure or cmake or whatever needed; it grabs what it needs directly from the source and header files. In fact, here's a list of all the files and their extensions (case insensitive) that qo knows about:

* C files: `.c`
* C++ files: `.cpp`, `.cxx`, `.c++`, `.cc`
	* note the case-insensitive part; `.C` is recognized as C, not C++
* C header files: `.h`, `.hpp`, `.hxx`, `.h++`, `.hh`
* Objective-C files: `.m` (**not yet implemented**)
* Objective-C++ files: `.mm` (**not yet implemented**)
* Windows Resource files: `.rc`
* TODO also need to add:
	* gresource files: `.gresource`
	* gettext files: `.po`
	* Qt Designer files (?????)
	* Qt Translator files (?????)
	* anything else (send ideas!)

That being said, there are ways to customize the build: the $CFLAGS, $CXXFLAGS, and $LDFLAGS environment variables, some command-line options, and special directives in the source and header files. These directives are of the form

```
// #qo thing: arguments...
```

where the whitespace up to and including the first space after `#qo` is significant.

The directives are

```
CFLAGS
CXXFLAGS
LDFLAGS
	just like the environment variables
pkg-config
	passes named packages to pkg-config and adds the results to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and LDFLAGS
```

Debug builds are simple: just pass `-g` to `qo`.

Cross-compiling is also simple: there's `-os`, `-arch`, and `-tc` commands for specifying target OS, architecture, and toolchain. (`-os` may change.)

For MinGW, use the default `gcc` on Windows and `mingwcc` on other OSs if you have the correct cross-compiler toolchain set up.

TODO conditional compilation via the filename, just like `go build`

`-x` shows a verbose build.

All C files are assumed C99; all C++ files C++11.

Still early in development, still rather unpolished, but suggestions welcome!

### A note on optional features
qo does not support the notion of optional features: everything in the recursive directory tree of the current directory is compiled. I personally don't like features being optional; if something really needs to be conditional, it should be a plugin, and there's no reason to ship a gimped or feature-incomplete version of a program. I don't like how graphviz packages in at least Ubuntu don't sihp with pic support (even though I'm probably the only person int he world that still uses troff).
