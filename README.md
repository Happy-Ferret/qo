qo is a simple program that builds C and C++ programs (though I can add more supported languages later).

Usage is simple:

```
$ cd project
$ ls
file.c file2.c file3.c file4.c project.h
$ qo
...
$ ./project
```

There's no makefile or configure or cmake or whatever needed; it grabs what it needs directly from the source and header files. In fact, here's a list of all the files and their extensions (case insensitive) that qo knows about:

* C files: `.c`
* C++ files: `.cpp`, `.cxx`, `.c++`, `.cc`
	* note the case-insensitive part; `.C` is recognized as C, not C++
* C header files: `.h`, `.hpp`, `.hxx`, `.h++`, `.hh`
* Objective-C files: `.m`
* Objective-C++ files: `.mm`
* Windows Resource files: `.rc`
* TODO also need to add:
	* gresource files: `.xml` with root tag `<gresources>`
	* Qt moc files (will need some way to distinguish; same as C headers)
	* Qt Designer files: `.ui` as XML with root tag `<ui>`
	* anything else (send ideas!)
* TODO can these be embedded?
	* gettext files: `.po`
	* Qt Linguist files: `.ts` as XML with root t ag `<TS>`
	* anything else (send ideas!)

qo also automatically builds with as many reasonable compiler diagnostics as possible enabled.

There are ways to customize the build: the $CFLAGS, $CXXFLAGS, and $LDFLAGS environment variables, some command-line options, and special directives in the source and header files. These directives are of the form

```
// #qo thing: arguments...
```

where the whitespace up to and including the first space after `#qo` is significant.

The directives are

```
CFLAGS
CXXFLAGS
LDFLAGS
	just like the environment variables
pkg-config
	passes named packages to pkg-config and adds the results to CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, and LDFLAGS
LIBS
	adds named libraries to LDFLAGS. Intended to make cross-compiling with MinGW and MSVC easier; for instance, LIBS: user32 will do -luser32 on MinGW and user32.lib on MSVC
```

Debug builds are simple: just pass `-g` to `qo`.

Cross-compiling is also simple: there's `-os`, `-arch`, and `-tc` commands for specifying target OS, architecture, and toolchain. (`-os` may change.)

To make cross-compiling easy, there are ways to mark a certain source file or directory as being only for a certain target OS, architecture, or both:

- For files, the filename must have `_OS`, `_arch`, or `_OS_arch` before the extension.
- For directories, the directory name must consist entirely of `OS`, `arch`, or `OS_arch`.

The list of supported OSs and architectures can be gathered with `-os list` and `-arch list`, respectively.

For MinGW, use the default `gcc` on Windows and `mingwcc` on other OSs if you have the correct cross-compiler toolchain set up.

`-x` shows a verbose build.

All C files are assumed C99; all C++ files C++11.

For MSVC builds, large address awareness is implied.

### On cross-compiling
(There is no cross-compiling with msvc; the following only applies to gcc and clang.)

Cross-compiling is a mess. Not only does gcc not natively cross-compile, but there's this thing called "multilib" which makes things far more complicated. And that doesn't get into the various BSDs that embed the OS version and build system in the target triplet.

qo makes the following compromise. Given the following terms:

**host** - the OS that qo is running on<br>
**target** - the OS/arch pair you choose to compile to; made the same as the host by default<br>
**unqualified binaries** - binaries named `gcc`, `g++`, `clang`, and `clang++`, without any target triplet<br>
**multilib flags** - `-m32` and `-m64`

1) If the `-target` option is passed to qo to explicitly specify a triplet to use, that triplet is used, no questions asked. No mulitlib flags will be appended to the command line.
2) Otherwise, if the target is the same as the host, unqualified binaries are run, and multilib flags may or may not be appended.
3) Otherwise, if the host OS is not Windows, if the host arch is either `386` or `amd64` and the target arch is either `386` or `amd64`, a multilib flag is appended, and the unqualified binaries are run.
4) Otherwise, if using clang, a generic target triplet is generated and used.
5) Otherwise, if the target OS is windows, MinGW-w64 binaries are used.
6) Otherwise, an error occurs.

### A note on optional features
qo does not support the notion of optional features: everything in the recursive directory tree of the current directory is compiled. I personally don't like features being optional; if something really needs to be conditional, it should be a plugin, and there's no reason to ship a gimped or feature-incomplete version of a program. I don't like how graphviz packages in at least Ubuntu don't sihp with pic support (even though I'm probably the only person int he world that still uses troff).

### Notes on MSVC
The version of MSVC used defines how much C99 or C++11 can be used.

The following seem to be undocumented as being MinGW extensions to the rc format:
- arithmetic expressions
